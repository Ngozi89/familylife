                <blockquote>“Speak with your children as if they are the wisest, kindest, most beautiful humans on earth, 
                    for what they
                    believe is
                    what they will become.”
                
                    Brooke Hampton</blockquote>
                
                <br>
                
                <blockquote>“Your kids require you most of all to love them for who they are, not to spend your whole 
                    time trying to
                    correct them.”
                
                    Bill Ayers</blockquote>
                
                <br>
                
                <blockquote>“Motherhood is a constant learning process that requires flexibility and a sense of humor. 
                    And just when you think you have it all figured out, your children like to remind you that you 
                    certainly don’t.” Stacey A. Shannon</blockquote>

            <blockquote>“Parenting shouldn’t feel like a competitive sport. It’s plenty challenging without any added 
                obstacles. Strive to be loving and kind; have the courage to ask for help; take a break when you need it; 
                celebrate all the great stuff; be kind to yourself, and be yourself. That’s who your kid loves anyways.”
            Ariadne Brill</blockquote>

            <br>

            <blockquote>“The point of parenting is not to have all the answers before we start out but instead to 
                figure it out on the go as our children grow. Because as they do, so will we.” Bridgett Miller</blockquote>

            <br>

            <blockquote>“If you’re completely exhausted and don’t know how you’re going to keep giving this 
                much of yourself day after day, you’re probably a good parent.” Bunmi Laditan</blockquote>
